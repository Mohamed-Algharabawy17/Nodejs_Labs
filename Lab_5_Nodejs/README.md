# NodeJS Task Description

This NodeJS task involves developing a server-side application for an e-commerce system. The server architecture is organized into different components, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Controllers Folder**: Contains controllers responsible for handling business logic related to different entities within the e-commerce system. Each root entity (items, orders, and users) has its own controller.

2. **Utils Folder**: Houses validation schemas utilizing AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator). These schemas are utilized to validate incoming data, ensuring its integrity and conformity to specified rules.

3. **Models Folder**: Handles the connection with MongoDB database. It contains MongoDB models that define the structure of data entities and provide methods for interacting with the database.

4. **Routes Folder**: Contains CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) routes for each entity within the e-commerce system. These routes define the API endpoints and are responsible for routing incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller methods.

## Server.js Content Overview

The `server.js` file provided serves as the entry point for the NodeJS server. Here's a brief overview of its content:

- **Express Setup**: Initializes an Express application.
- **Body Parser Configuration**: Configures Express to parse incoming request bodies in JSON format.
- **MongoDB Connection**: Connects to a MongoDB database named "E-Commerce" running on `localhost` at port `27017`.
- **Port Configuration**: Specifies the port on which the server should listen for incoming connections. It defaults to port `7008`.
- **Routes Configuration**: Sets up routes for different entities (items, orders, and users) using the respective route files (`ItemsRoutes`, `OrdersRoutes`, and `UsersRoutes`). These routes are prefixed with `/api/Items`, `/api/orders`, and `/api/users` respectively.

Upon successful database connection, the server starts listening on the specified port, and appropriate routes are registered to handle incoming requests.

## Usage

To utilize this server for your e-commerce application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the repository containing the server code.

3. Install dependencies by running: `npm i` or `npm install`

4. Make sure MongoDB is running locally on your machine.

5. start the server

6. Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints for different entities:
- Items: `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/Items`
- Orders: `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/orders`
- Users: `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/users`

Replace `<PORT>` with the actual port number specified in the `server.js` file.

7. You can now send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to these endpoints to interact with the e-commerce system.

## Notes

- Ensure that the MongoDB connection URI in the `server.js` file is accurate and points to your MongoDB instance.
- Customize the server according to your specific requirements, such as adding authentication, authorization, or additional functionality as needed.
- Refer to the documentation of Express.js, Mongoose, and AJV for further customization and extension possibilities.


## Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors that may occur during server operation, database interactions, or request processing.

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Enhance security by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive endpoints and data.

- **Logging**: Incorporate logging functionality to track server activities, monitor requests, and debug issues effectively.

- **Testing**: Develop comprehensive test suites to ensure the reliability, stability, and correctness of the server application. Utilize testing frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine for automated testing.

- **Documentation**: Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and usage guidelines comprehensively to facilitate integration with client applications and streamline development processes.

- **Scalability**: Design the server application with scalability in mind to accommodate potential future growth and increased user traffic. Consider utilizing microservices architecture, load balancing, and caching strategies for optimal performance.

- **Deployment**: Plan for deployment of the server application in a production environment. Choose appropriate hosting platforms such as AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean, and implement deployment automation using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or CI/CD pipelines.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this NodeJS task involves building a robust server-side application for an e-commerce system using Express.js, MongoDB, and AJV. By organizing the server architecture into distinct components and following best practices in development, deployment, and maintenance, you can create a scalable, secure, and efficient solution to meet the requirements of the e-commerce application.
